# GundamVerse Kits - Your Destiny, Built by You

## Project Overview

Welcome to **GundamVerse Kits**, an elegant e-commerce platform dedicated to bringing the exciting world of Gundam plastic model kits (GunPla) to enthusiasts and builders everywhere. Our mission is to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing online store where customers can explore, select, and purchase their favorite Mobile Suits.

This project is built using HTML and Bootstrap 5, incorporating custom CSS for a distinctive Gundam-themed aesthetic.

## Features

* **Responsive Navigation Bar:** Easy-to-use navigation that adapts to various screen sizes, featuring categories like Master Grade (MG), High Grade (HG), Perfect Grade (PG), and Accessories.
* **Immersive Hero Section:** A striking introductory section with a compelling headline and call-to-action, designed to immediately engage visitors.
* **Featured Kits Carousel:** A dynamic image carousel showcasing popular or newly released Gundam kits, grabbing attention and highlighting key products.
* **Product Display Cards:** Well-structured and visually appealing product cards for individual model kits, displaying images, titles, brief descriptions, prices, and an "Add to Cart" button.
* **Gundam-Themed Aesthetics:** Custom CSS enhances the Bootstrap framework with a color scheme (dark blues, reds, silvers) and design elements inspired by the Gundam universe, providing a cohesive and immersive Browse experience.
* **Clean and Modern Design:** Utilizes Bootstrap 5's utility classes and a custom stylesheet to achieve a polished and contemporary look.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For structuring the content of the web pages.
* **CSS3:** For styling and visual presentation.
* **Bootstrap 5:** A powerful front-end toolkit for responsive design and pre-built components.
